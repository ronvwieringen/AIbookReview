AIbookReview.com is an online platform designed to support the self-publishing community. We use advanced AI to provide an objective quality assessment of manuscripts.

***Is the platform available in different languages?***  
Yes. Our AI is designed to analyze manuscripts in multiple languages from the start. The platform's user interface will also be translated into different languages over time as we expand internationally.

***How do I create an account?***  
You can sign up for a free account using your email address and a password, or by using a Single Sign-On (SSO) option with your existing Google, Microsoft, or Facebook account. During registration, you will be asked to select your primary role (e.g., Author, Reader, Service Provider).

**For Authors**

***What happens to my manuscript after I upload it? Is it secure?***  
Your intellectual property and security are our top priorities. Your manuscript file is used only for the one-time AI analysis. Immediately after the analysis is complete, the file is permanently and irretrievably deleted from our servers. We do not store your manuscript.

***Who owns the rights to my work?***  
You do. You retain 100% of the rights and ownership of your manuscript and its content. Our role is simply to analyze the work you provide and then delete it.  
What kind of feedback will I receive from the AI analysis?  
The AI provides a comprehensive review that includes:

* An overall **AI Quality Score** (e.g., out of 100).  
* A **plagiarism check** summary.  
* A concise, catchy **promotional blurb** (approx. 25 words).  
* A short summary of the book and the review itself.  
* **Detailed feedback** on aspects like language, style, plot, structure, character development, and pacing.  
* Suggestions for where you might benefit from professional services (e.g., copy editing, cover design).

***Do I have to make my AI review public?***  
No. All reviews are private by default. You have full control and can choose to publish your review to make it visible on the platform whenever you are ready.

***What if I don't agree with the AI's feedback?***  
We understand that an AI review is a tool, not a final verdict. The platform provides a feature for you to write your own response or add nuance to the AI's comments. This author's response will be displayed publicly alongside the AI review if you choose to publish it.

***How can the platform help me find an editor or designer?***  
Our platform includes a "Service Provider Marketplace" where you can search for and connect with professional editors, designers, coaches, and more. Additionally, our AI analysis will signal areas where your manuscript could benefit from specific services, helping you identify what kind of help to look for.

***Do I have to disclose my own use of AI tools in my writing?***  
As part of our commitment to transparency, we offer an "Author's Process Checklist." This is a voluntary checklist where you can share details about your creation process, including whether you used professional services or AI tools for brainstorming, writing, or editing.

**For Readers**

***How can I find good self-published books on this platform?***  
You can use our advanced search and filtering tools to discover books based on genre, language, AI Quality Score, reader ratings, and keywords. The platform also provides personalized recommendations based on your profile and reading preferences.

***What information can I see about a book before deciding to buy?***  
For any public review, you can see the book's AI Quality Score, the AI-generated blurb, other reader reviews and ratings, the author's personal response to the AI feedback, and the Author's Process Checklist, which provides transparency about how the book was created.

***How do I buy a book I find on AIbookReview.com?***  
We provide "Where to Buy" links on the book's review page. These links, added by the author or publisher, will take you directly to online bookstores or other sales channels where you can purchase the book.

***Can I interact with authors or other readers?***  
Yes. The platform is designed as a community hub. You can participate in discussion forums, join Q\&A sessions with authors, and follow your favorite authors or reviewers to receive updates.

**For Service Providers & Publishers**

***I'm an editor/designer. How can I find clients on this platform?***  
As a registered Service Provider, you can create a detailed professional profile showcasing your skills, portfolio, and rates. Authors can find you through our marketplace directory. More importantly, our AI signals authors when their manuscript could benefit from services like yours, creating a stream of qualified leads.

***I'm a publisher/agent. How can AIbookReview.com help me find new talent?***  
We offer a "Talent Scouting Dashboard" for our registered partners. This provides paid access to our database, allowing you to efficiently search and filter reviews and discover promising new authors in the self-publishing space. You cannot access any manuscripts through our platform, since we do not store them.

Of course. Here is a new chapter for the FAQ document, specifically about the APIs that AIhttps://www.google.com/search?q=bookReview.com offers, based on the requirements provided.

### **For Platform Partners & Developers (API)**

***Does AIbookReview.com offer an API?***

Yes. A core part of our platform is a robust and well-documented API designed for our strategic partners, such as self-publishing platforms.

***Who is the API for?***

The API is intended for approved Platform Partners who want to integrate our quality assessment features and data into their own workflows and services. For instance, a self-publishing platform that offers services like printing-on-demand and a shop, can add the creation of a review by us to their workflow easily.

***How can my platform get access to the API?***

Access is provided to registered and approved partners. The process involves a secure registration, after which you will be issued an API key to access the system.

***What kind of data can we access through the API?***

With author consent, our API allows partners to retrieve a wide range of data to enhance their own platforms. This includes:

* Submitting a manuscript for review.  
* Getting the results of the review back so you can act upon them in your workflow.  
* Getting the public URL of the book review in our platform.  
* Pushing URLs to our platform to fill our list of ‘where to buy this book’.  
* Get the book registered in our Public AI review details (including the AI Quality Score, promotional blurb, and full feedback).  
* Setting the statuses of the Author's Process Checklist.  
* Public author profile information.  
* Reader reviews and ratings.

***Can we manage book information via the API?***

Yes. The API allows authenticated partners to add or update the "Where to Buy" URLs for books. You can also manage the public visibility of a review (toggling it between "Public" and "Private"), provided you have the author's consent.

***Is it possible to receive real-time updates for events?***

Yes, this is a planned feature. We are developing a webhook system that will allow your platform to subscribe to and receive automatic notifications for key events, such as when an author's AI analysis is complete or when a book receives a significant new review.

***Is the API secure?***

Absolutely. The API is secured using unique API keys and requires proper authentication and authorization for all requests to ensure that data is handled safely and appropriately.

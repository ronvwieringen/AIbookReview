2\. Information We Collect  
We collect various types of information to provide and improve our services.  
**2.1. Information You Provide Directly**

  * **Manuscripts:** You may upload a manuscript file (.PDF, .docx, .txt, .md) for the sole purpose of a one-time AI analysis.  
  * **Metadata:** We collect metadata about your book, such as title, author name, language, book type, and ISBN.  
  * **Profile Details:** You can provide a comprehensive CV/bio, a profile picture, and a link to your external website.

* **Blogger/Reviewer Information:** We collect your blog URL and social media links to enhance your profile.

**2.2. Information We Generate**

* **Anonymized Metadata:** We may store and use anonymized metadata for analysis and platform improvement.

3\. How We Use Your Information  
We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

* **To Provide Core Services:** To perform the AI analysis of your manuscript, provide feedback, and generate your review results.  
* **To Operate the Platform:** To create and manage your user account, display your public profile, and enable platform functionalities like search and discovery.  
* **To Facilitate Connections:**  
  * Authors can find and contact Service Providers based on their needs, including those signaled by our AI.  
  * Readers, Bloggers, and literary agents can discover authors and their work.  
* **To Enable Partner Integration:** Affiliated self-publishing platforms can retrieve review data via our API with author consent to streamline their workflow.  
* **For Talent Scouting:** We offer paid access to our database for talent scouts, literary agents, and traditional publishers to discover new, quality-assessed manuscripts.  
* **For Communication:** To send you notifications about key events, such as the completion of your review, or to allow messaging between users (e.g., author to service provider).  
* **For Reporting and Trends:** We may use anonymized, aggregated data to create market insights and trend reports.

4\. How We Share Your Information  
Your information is shared in the following ways:

* **Publicly (With Your Control):**  
  * Authors have full control over the visibility of their AI review. It is "Private" by default and only made public if you explicitly choose to do so.  
  * If you set a review to "Public," it will be visible to other users alongside your public author profile, the process checklist summary, and your response to the review.  
  * Service Provider and Blogger/Reviewer profiles are visible to help users discover them.  
* **With Platform Partners:** With an author's consent, we share AI review data (scores, blurbs, checklist status) and public profile information with our integrated self-publishing platform partners via a secure API.  
* **With Service Providers:** Authors seeking services can view detailed provider profiles. AI-signaled needs for services may be used to create qualified leads for providers.  
* **For Talent Scouting:** Registered and approved talent scouts and publishers have paid access to search and filter our database of public reviews for talent discovery.

5\. Data Security and Retention  
We are committed to protecting your information and intellectual property.

* **Manuscript Deletion:** This is a cornerstone of our platform. **Your uploaded manuscript file is used only for the one-time analysis and is permanently and irretrievably deleted from our servers immediately after the analysis is complete.** We do not store your manuscript permanently.  
* **Data Storage:** Only the metadata, the AI-generated review results, and your checklist information are stored in our database, with your permission.  
* **Security Measures:** We implement robust security measures to protect your data. This includes:  
  * Encryption of sensitive data like passwords and API keys, both in transit and at rest.  
  * Strict role-based access control to ensure users can only access data they are authorized to see.  
  * Secure authentication mechanisms for all user accounts.  
* **Data Retention:** We will store your personal data and generated content as long as your account is active. We will define clear data retention policies for inactive accounts and other stored data in compliance with legal requirements.
